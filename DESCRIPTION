Description: While analyzing geospatial data, easy visualization is often
    needed that allows for quick plotting, and simple, but easy interactivity.
    Additionally, visualizing geospatial data in projected coordinates is also
    desirable. The 'quickmapr' package provides a simple method to visualize 
    'sp', 'sf' (via coercion to 'sp'), and 'raster' objects, allows for basic 
    zooming, panning, identifying,labeling, selecting, and measuring spatial 
    objects.  Importantly, it does not require that the data be in geographic 
    coordinates.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.0.0)
Imports:
    raster,
    sp,
    httr,
    stats,
    grDevices,
    graphics,
    methods,
    sf
Suggests:
    testthat,
    knitr
